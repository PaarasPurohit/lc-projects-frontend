I just finished coding a battleship client on NodeJs, and it (NodeJs) worked really well. I mean, NodeJS worked like a charm, and I also think my battleship player/client is not too shaby.

I'm quite impressed with little thing that NodeJS is. Firstly, the event-based flow makes it ideal for http/asynch apps. Secondly, it is native Java script, so it super easy to send and receive JSON.

I like my stacks and queues:
