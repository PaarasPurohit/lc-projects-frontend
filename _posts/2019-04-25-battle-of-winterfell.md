This is a comprehensive guide to the Battle of Winterfell, based on information I have collected from Reddit and other online sources. It will hopefully give a better visualization and build up to this Sunday's episode - the logistics and the breakdown of the forces of the living and the dead.

*Battle Formations.*

## The Living

12500 Unsullied - In S03E04, the number of Unsullied was estimated to be 8000 combat ready troops and 5000 trainees. Since Dany killed the Masters, no more unsullied troops were trained. A few would have died to the Harpies, few during the sea journey to Westeros and maybe a couple during the storming of Casterly Rock - so around 500 dead. Commanded by Grey Worm (I'm gonna miss him)

12000 Northern Infantry - Mostly Karstark, remaining Stark, Manderly, other Northern houses and Valemen (seen in the trailer) - commanded by Lady Brienne and assisted by Jaime Lannister on the left flank

10000 Dothraki Screamers - In S07E07, we are told that 10000 Dothraki screamers ride for Kings Landing. This contradicts the initial claim that the size of Dany's Khalasaar was 100000. One possible explanation I found on Reddit was that some of the Dothraki where left with the Second Sons in Slaver's Bay and many died in the following battles: The Siege of Mereen (S06E09) and The Field of Fire (S07E04). And a Khalasaar may basically include women, children and men who many not be considered of military age. And Dany would have also left some of them on her Southern Conquests, namely Dragonstone and Casterly Rock - 2 regiments - one possible under the control of Jorah as we see him in the trailer and on S08E02 ending with them

2000 Knights of the Vale - In S06E07, Littlefinger tells Sansa that 2000 mounted Knights of the Vale are garrisoned at Moat Cailin - led by Lord Yohn Royce, they will form the cavalry on the left flank.

1200 Northern Cavalry

400 Night's Watch, Freefolk and Brotherhood w/o Banners - Possibly the right flank. The garrison from the remaining castles of the Nights Watch, the free folk who survived Hardhome and the Battle of the Bastards and the company that regrouped at the Last Hearth

40 Mormonts - In S06E07, its said that House Mormont has 62 men. Rough estimate that 22 of them perished at the Battle of the Bastards - possible guarding the gates to the crypt

40 Ironborn - Theon was given just one ship, a rough estimate of the crew needed to man a ship - Three Eyed Raven duty

25 Heroes - Jon, Brienne, Jaime, Jorah, Arya, Gendry, Podrick, the Hound, Beric etc.

8 Artillery Batteries - Will accompany the Unsullied

5 Valyrian Steel swords - Longclaw (Jon), Oathkeeper (Brienne), Widow's Wail (Jaime), Heartsbane (Jorah), Arya's Valyrian steel dagger

2 Dragons - Drogon (and Dany) and Rhaegal

1 Dire Wolf - Ghost

So, that's a total of 38000 (25000 infantry, 13000 mounted units, 2 dragons and 1 wolf).

## The Dead

The Night King

Viserion

![Nights King](/img/posts/battle-of-winterfell/nights-king.jpg)
*Night's King.*

White Walkers - Craster's sons. 98 of them (little Sam was the 99th). Jon killed 2 and Sam killed 1 and Meera killed 1, so 94 approx., though we see only 12 in the trailer

3 Giant Wights - shown during the destruction of the wall in Season 7 finale and Hodor

100000 human wights and basically anyone who dies from the army of the living

Unknown number of animals including horses, bears, Summer

Thats around 130000. They are gonna outnumber the living 3:1.
