Here are the steps to apply for Global Entry from the US, if you're on a US Visa like the H1B or the F1.

### 1. Complete the Global Entry Program (GEP) application on CBP's Trusted Travel Program website

Create an account and fill out the GEP application at <a href="https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/" target="\_blank">https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/</a>. You are required to pay a fee of $100 as part of the application.

### 2. On the Passport Seva Portal, fill out the Global Entry program background check application

Once you submit the Global Entry Program (GEP) application on the CBP website, you will get an application ID (GES/GOES ID). Use this ID to apply for a background verification for GEP on the <a href="https://www.passportindia.gov.in/AppOnlineProject/online/gepOnlineApp" target="\_blank">Passport Seva Portal</a>. After submitting the GEP background verification application, note the Application Reference Number (ARN). Skip step 3 if you plan to attend the interview in person, in India.

### 3. On VFS Global, create an account and submit the Global Entry Program application

Visit the <a href="https://services.vfsglobal.com/one-pager/india/united-states-of-america/global-entry-program/" target="\blank">VFS Global Entry Program application page</a> and create a profile.  Create a new application under the category "GEP". Make sure you select the correct VFS application center based on your jurisdiction. Include the ARN from Passport Seva Portal and fill in all details in the application. Print and sign.

Once you complete the application on the VFS website, print all supporting documents, including your VFS GEP application, Passport Seva application, CBP application reference, and include two photographs. There is a <a href="https://services.vfsglobal.com/one-pager/india/united-states-of-america/global-entry-program/pdf/passport-checklist-gep.pdf" target="\=blank">checklist</a> of documents required for the Global Entry program for Indian citizens, provided by VFS. You can use the shipment services provided by VFS to avoid any hassles.

### 4. Schedule Interview after Conditional Approval

After background verification, your application will be conditionally approved. You will then need to <a href="https://ttp.cbp.dhs.gov/" target="\_blank">schedule an interview</a> and visit a global entry office located at the listed airports.

In the end, I would say that this is definitely worth it and even avoids the hassle of travelling to India. There are also credit cards that reimburse the application fee like the Chase Sapphire Reserve, Amex Platinum and the US Bank Altitude Reserve, so this is a no brainer.
