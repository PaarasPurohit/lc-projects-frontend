## About

Hi, I'm Yves Espinosa. A Computer Science student in University of Southern Philippines Foundation. Mostly I work night-time, the peace and quite, the internal serenity...Often in solitude in night, I solve problems mere mortal could only dream of.

Recently, I started working iOS applications.
