## About

I am a software developer, and computer software is my pasion, my job, and my hobby. 
I believe in devops, agile practices, open source and making code a social and humanistic endevour.
I also believe that processes, tools and team interaction are as important as individual prowes, and that high performing teams are the main artifact to strive to.

### Me and software

As with other things of the heart, it is difficult to explain my feelings for software develompent, but I'll try. 
Software development brings with it supremely grattifying experienses: the pride of defeating frustration, 
the thrill of finding the solution to a puzzle, the sense of accomplishment of constantly learning new things,
 the intellectual fullfilment of meeting intelligent and interesting people, 
and the camaraderie of achieving a goal with a team.
