## About

Automatisation, Orchestration, Continuous Integration and Delivery Evangelist.

I work in IT for 10 years in different position such as Unix/Linux System Administrator, System Developer and Automation Specialist.

Focusing for the last 5 years on IT automation, I had the chance to develop and learn methodologies, tools and systems to simplify, optimize and strengthen bare metal, virtual and cloud infrastructures.
This thanks to Infrastructure as Code, Configuration Management, Runbook Automation, Analytics and Monitoring, Machine Learning and more via languages such as Python, Ruby, Go, HCL and Bash.

You can find here some about me and more about what I do through some blog posts.
<br />Enjoy the read !
