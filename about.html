## About

I am a software developer. Computer software is my passion, my profession, and my hobby. 

I believe in DevOps, agile practices, open source, and that coding should be a social and humanistic endeavour. I also believe that processes, tools, and team interaction are as important as individual prowess, and that high performing teams are the main artifact to strive for.

### Me and software

As with other things of the heart, it is difficult to explain my feelings for software development. Though, I can always try. Software development brings with it supremely gratifying experiences: the pride of defeating frustration, the thrill of finding the solution to a puzzle, the sense of accomplishment of constantly learning new things, the intellectual fulfilment of meeting intelligent and interesting people, and the camaraderie of achieving a goal with a team.
